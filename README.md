# BetterWords

BetterWords is a crowd sourcing platform for words! It will serve as a resource as we strive to recognize harmful ideas that have become the norm in our language and give a platform for brainstorming better words.

For example, a user could ask for alternatives for the term “grandfathered in” which is an american term that originates from a process of enabling white people to vote with ease while still supressing black peoples' right to vote. If your grandfather had voted in previous elections (which in 1876 obviously excluded black southerners), then you could skip all literacy tests and fees.

Then other users could suggest better words, such as “loyalty program” or “legacy”. Similar to stack overflow, better word suggestions would be sorted based on how helpful or accurate other users found it (sentiment would be tracked through a voting system).
